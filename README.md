<h5>C# is an object - oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET framework.</h5>
<h5>C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and JAVA.</h5>
-->
  <h5>Why use C#?</h5>
  <h5>-> Most Popular programming Language in the world</h5>
  <h5>-> It is easy to learn and simple to use</h5>
<h5>-> It gives you a clear structure to program and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs</h5>
